Anthropic remains a transitional adapter only.\n\n## Scope\n- Keep Python intent parsing and command UX iteration moving\n- Preserve the provider boundary in `IntentParser` (provider swap, not parser rewrite)\n- Implement a local SLM provider that returns the same JSON action schema as the current API-backed path\n- Reduce end-to-end SLM latency and remove network dependency for ambiguous/mixed utterances\n\n## Model Choice (Current Candidate)\n- **Qwen3-0.6B** is the current candidate for local intent parsing\n- Focus on intent parsing / action-sequence generation reliability, not general chat quality\n- Constrain output to the existing JSON action schema\n\n## Runtime Direction\n- **Target runtime:** Rust/Candle (local inference path)\n- Python can continue to ship before the Rust port by calling a local provider (e.g. subprocess/daemon) behind the provider interface\n- Do not deepen direct Anthropic coupling in `intent.py`\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Keep SLM I/O contract stable: `system_prompt + transcript -> JSON action array`\n- Reuse current fallback behavior (fast path first, SLM only for ambiguous utterances, dictation fallback on failure)\n- Add replay-based eval fixtures for quality/latency comparison vs API path\n- Async intent parsing (`bd-c2f`) should be compatible with the same provider interface\n\n## Open Questions / Follow-up Decisions\n- Candle integration shape for Phase 1: subprocess service vs tighter embedding during Rust migration\n- Model format/quantization packaging (GGUF or Candle-native artifacts)\n- Grammar-constrained decoding strategy for JSON/schema validity","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-24T03:42:40.349729Z","created_by":"davegraham","updated_at":"2026-02-24T05:54:38.287679Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["latency","phase-1"]}
